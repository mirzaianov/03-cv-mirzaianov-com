      content="Hi! I'm Riaz Mirzaianov, a frontend developer.
    I've been coding for 1.5 years. I started with HTML, CSS & JavaScript and later found joy in building React-based apps. I am solid in Algorithms, have skills in Figma. I'm eager to create eye-catching interfaces with cutting-edge web technologies. I am focused on blending aesthetics and functionality, driven by a keen eye for detail."
